# Malaysia-Airlines-Reservation-System
Designed, implemented and documented a database system for Malaysia Airline Reservation System using Microsoft SQL with my peers.

During the designing phase, ERD and EERD were first drawm. Below shows the ERD and EERD for the designed reservation system.
## ERD

## EERD

After the ERD and EERD were drawn a database schema was then created. There are two database schema categories, strong table and weak table below shows an example of a strong table and a weak table.
## Strong table

Once the designed phase has been completed, the designed system was then implemented in SQL. Below shows a sample output:
